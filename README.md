No longer do you need an entire beach or even a friend to play tic-tac-toe. No you can play alone in the middle of the night right in your web browser.

You can choose to be either X or O, the game resets automatically after alerting the player of the result, and you can also reset the game prematurely after you realize you're being beaten by a mostly stupid AI.
